# Neural Network Grade Prediction Model

## Overview

ðŸš€ **Welcome to the Neural Network Grade Prediction Model!** ðŸš€

In this project, I developed a robust Python-based system that combines neural network techniques with comprehensive data processing to predict student acceptance decisions. The model evaluates student performance using TEAS scores, GPA, and additional criteria, and is designed to process data from various file formatsâ€”including PDF, CSV, JSON, and TXT.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Hybrid Evaluation System:** Integrates a neural network model with traditional evaluation functions to assess student readiness.
- **Multi-Format Data Integration:** Seamlessly extracts and processes data from PDFs, CSVs, JSON files, and text files.
- **Neural Network Implementation:** Utilizes a simple neural network with 2 input neurons, 4 hidden neurons, and 1 output neuron. The model performs both forward and backward passes, updating weights via gradient descent.
- **Automated Grade Prediction:** Automatically generates test data, evaluates student records, and exports results for further analysis.

## Features

- **Neural Network Architecture**  
  - **Structure:** 2 input neurons, 4 hidden neurons, and 1 output neuron.
  - **Forward Pass:** Processes inputs through layers using weights, biases, and a sigmoid activation function.
  - **Backward Pass:** Calculates gradients of the loss with respect to weights and biases and updates them via gradient descent.

- **Comprehensive Data Processing**  
  - **PDF Extraction:** Uses `PyPDF2` and `tabula-py` to extract text and table data.
  - **Multi-Format Support:** Includes dedicated processors for CSV, JSON, and TXT files.
  - **Dynamic Header Management:** Automatically updates and maintains data headers during processing.

- **Grade Prediction & Evaluation**  
  - Evaluates student acceptance based on TEAS scores, GPA, and predefined criteria.
  - Generates synthetic test data for validation and testing purposes.
  - Exports processed results to an Excel file (`Name&Teas.xlsx`) for easy review.

- **Modular & Extensible Design**  
  - Organized into clear, dedicated classes (`PDFProcessor`, `CSVProcessor`, `JSONProcessor`, `TXTProcessor`) for easy maintenance and future expansion.
  - Seamlessly combines multiple data sources into unified DataFrames.

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **numpy** for numerical operations
- **pandas** for data manipulation
- **tabula-py** for extracting tables from PDFs
- **PyPDF2** for PDF text extraction
- **pdfminer.six** (as an alternative PDF text extraction tool)
- **json** and **os** for file handling
- **random** for test data generation

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sngalamou/NeuralNetworkGradePrediction.git
   cd NeuralNetworkGradePrediction
   ```

2. **Create & Activate a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Ensure that `requirements.txt` includes all necessary packages: numpy, pandas, tabula-py, PyPDF2, pdfminer.six, etc.*

## Usage

1. **Prepare Your Data File**  
   Place your data file (PDF, CSV, JSON, or TXT) in the designated directory (e.g., `static/testData`).

2. **Run the Notebook or Script**  
   - **Jupyter Notebook:**  
     Launch the notebook to interact with the code:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook neuralNetwork.ipynb
     ```
   - **Python Script:**  
     Alternatively, run the script directly if available:
     ```bash
     python neuralNetwork.py
     ```

3. **Follow On-Screen Prompts**  
   The program will prompt you to enter the file name (including its extension). It will then process the file, extract the relevant data, evaluate each studentâ€™s record, and decide on their acceptance status.

4. **Review the Output**  
   Processed data is saved as an Excel file named `Name&Teas.xlsx` with a sheet titled "Name & Tease Scores". Open this file to review the processed student data and evaluation outcomes.
